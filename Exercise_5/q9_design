Design a Library Catalog System

Step 1: Identify Library Items
	•	Library items may include:
	•	Book
	•	Magazine
	•	DVD
	•	CD
	•	eBook
	•	Audiobook

Step 2: Design the Class Diagram

Base Class: LibraryItem
	•	Attributes:
	•	title (string)
	•	author (string)
	•	publicationYear (integer)
	•	itemID (unique identifier)
	•	status (string; e.g., “available”, “borrowed”)
	•	Methods:
	•	displayInfo()
	•	borrowItem()
	•	returnItem()

Sub-Classes (each inherits from LibraryItem):
	1.	Book
	•	Additional Attributes:
	•	ISBN (string)
	•	publisher (string)
	•	pages (integer)
	•	edition (string)
	•	Additional Methods:
	•	reserveBook()
	2.	Magazine
	•	Additional Attributes:
	•	issueNumber (integer)
	•	publicationMonth (string)
	•	Additional Methods:
	•	getIssueDetails()
	3.	DVD
	•	Additional Attributes:
	•	director (string)
	•	duration (integer, in minutes)
	•	rating (string)
	•	Additional Methods:
	•	playPreview()
	4.	CD
	•	Additional Attributes:
	•	artist (string)
	•	duration (integer, in minutes)
	•	Additional Methods:
	•	playSample()
	5.	eBook
	•	Additional Attributes:
	•	fileFormat (string; e.g., PDF, EPUB)
	•	downloadLink (URL)
	•	Additional Methods:
	•	openEBook()
	6.	Audiobook
	•	Additional Attributes:
	•	narrator (string)
	•	audioLength (integer, in minutes)
	•	Additional Methods:
	•	playSampleAudio()

Step 3: Define Basic Functions for the Catalog
	•	Adding Items: A function that creates a new instance of the appropriate LibraryItem subclass and adds it to the catalog.
	•	Removing Items: A function that removes an item from the catalog based on its itemID.
	•	Searching for Items: A function that allows users to search for items by title, author, or keywords (with possible filtering by item type).
	•	Borrowing Items: A function that checks an item’s status, processes the borrow request, and updates the status to “borrowed.”
	•	Returning Items: A function that processes the return of an item and updates its status to “available.”

Step 4: Draw a Sequence Diagram

Scenario: User borrows an item from the catalog.

Actors: User, Library Catalog System, LibraryItem

Sequence:
	1.	The User sends a search request (e.g., for a Book).
	2.	The Library Catalog System retrieves and displays matching search results.
	3.	The User selects an item to borrow.
	4.	The Library Catalog System checks the item’s availability.
	5.	If the item is available, the system processes the borrow request, updates the item’s status to “borrowed,” and confirms the transaction.
	6.	If the item is not available, the system informs the user.
