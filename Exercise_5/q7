7. UML Class Diagrams

1. Read through the Geeks for Geeks pages about UML class diagrams
- I have read and understood the basics of UML class diagrams including classes attributes methods inheritance and relationships

2. Look around you and describe items in an inheritance hierarchy
- Example a transportation system
- Base class vehicle
- Subclasses car bike truck

3. Model these objects as you would use them in a computer application
- vehicle base class
  - properties brand model speed
  - methods start stop accelerate
- car subclass of vehicle
  - properties num_doors fuel_type
  - methods play_music open_trunk
- bike subclass of vehicle
  - properties type has_gears
  - methods ring_bell adjust_seat
- truck subclass of vehicle
  - properties load_capacity num_wheels
  - methods load_cargo unload_cargo

4. Identify polymorphically overridden methods
- the accelerate method would be overridden in subclasses
  - car accelerate increases speed based on fuel consumption
  - bike accelerate increases speed based on pedaling force
  - truck accelerate increases speed but is limited by load weight

5. Identify completely different properties
- car num_doors fuel_type
- bike type has_gears
- truck load_capacity num_wheels

6. Use UML class diagram to visually represent the structure and relationships
- created a UML diagram using draw io to represent the vehicle hierarchy
